## Scales of Measurement:

<br>

> The scales of measurement are a way to classify data based on their attributes and the mathematical operations that can be performed on them. 

## Scales of Measurement:

They are classified into four types:

- Nominal scale.

- Ordinal scale.

- Interval scale.

- Ratio scale.

## Nominal Scale

> Categorizes data without any order or rank.

## Nominal Scale Examples {background-color=teal}

| Variable                | Example Values                           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Gender**              | Male, Female, Non-binary                 |
| **Religion**            | Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist |
| **Marital Status**      | Single, Married, Divorced, Widowed       |
| **Political Party**     | BJP, Congress, AAP, CPI                  |
| **Blood Type**          | A, B, AB, O                              |
| **Nationality**         | Indian, German, Australian, Argentinian  |
| **Color Names**         | Red, Blue, Green, Yellow                 |
| **Types of Transport**  | Bus, Train, Bicycle, Car                 |
| **Academic Discipline** | Sociology, Physics, History, Economics   |

## Ordinal Scale

> Data with a meaningful order but unequal intervals.

## Ordinal Scale Examples {background-color=teal}

| Variable                       | Example Values                                                        | Notes                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Education Level**            | Primary < Secondary < Graduate < Postgraduate                         | Rank exists, but interval not equal |
| **Socioeconomic Status**       | Low < Middle < High                                                   | Ordered categories                  |
| **Agreement Level**            | Strongly Disagree < Disagree < Neutral < Agree < Strongly Agree       | Likert scale                        |
| **Customer Satisfaction**      | Very Unsatisfied < Unsatisfied < Neutral < Satisfied < Very Satisfied | Common in surveys                   |
| **Military Ranks**             | Captain < Major < Colonel                                             | Hierarchical but no fixed interval  |
| **Class Position**             | First < Second < Third                                                | Ranks exist, differences unknown    |
| **Pain Level (self-reported)** | No pain < Mild < Moderate < Severe                                    | Ordered, subjective                 |

## Interval Scale

> Ordered data with equal intervals but no true zero point.

## Interval Scale Examples {background-color=teal}

| Variable                                    | Explanation                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Temperature in °C or °F**                 | The difference between 20°C and 30°C is the same as between 30°C and 40°C, but 0°C ≠ no temperature. |
| **IQ Scores**                               | An IQ of 120 is 20 points more than 100, but not "twice as intelligent" as someone with 60.          |
| **Calendar Years**                          | 2020 and 2025 are 5 years apart, but 0 AD is not the start of time.                                  |
| **Time of Day (on a 12-hr or 24-hr clock)** | 6 PM is 3 hours after 3 PM, but 0:00 (midnight) is not a true zero.                                  |
| **Standardized Test Scores**                | E.g., SAT or GRE scores — differences are meaningful, but zero doesn’t mean “no knowledge.”          |

## Ratio Scale

> Ordered data with equal intervals and a true zero point.

## Ratio Scale Examples {background-color=teal}

| Variable                  | Example Values                | True Zero? | Notes                                        |

| **Height**                | 160 cm, 170 cm, 180 cm        | Yes        | 0 cm = no height                             |
| **Weight**                | 50 kg, 70 kg, 0 kg            | Yes        | You can say 70 kg is twice as heavy as 35 kg |
| **Income**                | ₹0, ₹10,000, ₹50,000          | Yes        | 0 = no income                                |
| **Age**                   | 0 years, 25 years, 50 years   | Yes        | 0 = no age                                   |
| **Distance**              | 0 km, 5 km, 10 km             | Yes        | 0 = no distance                              |
| **Duration (time)**       | 0 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour | Yes        | 0 = no time elapsed                          |
| **Number of Children**    | 0, 1, 2, 3                    | Yes        | 0 = no children                              |
| **Calories consumed**     | 0 kcal, 500 kcal, 2000 kcal   | Yes        | 0 = no calories                              |
| **Marks or Scores (raw)** | 0 to 100                      | Yes        | 0 = no correct answers                       |
